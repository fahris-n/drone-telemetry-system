A simulated drone telemetry platform that generates real-time drone data, streams it via Kafka, and stores it for historical analysis.  
This project demonstrates event-driven architecture, containerized deployment, and integration across multiple backend technologies.

---

## 📖 Overview

- **Simulation**: Python spawns and simulates multiple drone objects.  
- **Streaming**: Each drone writes telemetry (location, altitude, speed, battery, etc.) to a Kafka topic every second.  
- **Persistence**: A Spring Boot backend consumes messages from Kafka and stores telemetry data in Postgres for long-term historical storage.  
- **Deployment**: All services run in Docker containers, deployed on an Ubuntu VM with automated setup and configuration handled by Ansible.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python** – Drone simulation & Kafka producer  
- **Apache Kafka** – Message broker for telemetry events  
- **Spring Boot** – Backend consumer & API development  
- **Postgres** – Historical data storage  
- **Docker & Docker Compose** – Containerized deployment and networking
- **VMware + Ubuntu 24 ARM** – Virtualized deployment environment
- **Ansible** - Configuration and application deployment

---

## 🛠️ Planned Architecture

The long-term vision of this project expands beyond the current pipeline (Python → Kafka → Spring Boot → Postgres) into a full telemetry and analytics ecosystem.  

Key planned components:   
- **Historical Analytics API** → Queryable endpoints for long-term data insights.  
- **RedisConsumer + WebSocketManager** → Streams real-time drone locations to the frontend.  
- **InfluxDBConsumer + Grafana** → Time-series dashboards per drone (speed, altitude, battery).  
- **AlertConsumer** → Real-time alerts feeding into Redis and the frontend.  
- **Frontend (React + Vite)** → Interactive UI combining live tracking, dashboards, and analytics.

# ✅ Deployment Automation (Achieved)

The deployment pipeline is fully functional and automated.  
This project is running on a remote **Ubuntu 24 ARM VM**, configured and deployed entirely via **Ansible**.

The playbook handles all necessary setup, including:
- Deep volume cleanup  
- Correct secret injection  
- Successful database initialization
