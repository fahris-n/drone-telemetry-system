- Make a more robust drone simulation
    - Add flight paths (start from a base and travel to OP local in a straight line. When at OP, travel in a circle above target for surveillance)
    - Add Mission logic and have status reflect this. Start in TAKEOFF -> TRANSIT_TO_AO -> ON_STATION -> RTB
        - After X hours or at X.X% battery, trigger RTB
    - Add Anomalies % chance per update cycle
        - 1% chance of emergency. Change status to EMERGENCY
        - 2% change of GPS jamming (erratic position)
    - Change current drone fleet
        - Focus on creating ~5 really in depth drones that do the above
        - Keep the area to one mission sector. This allows us to launch the drones from one Base, greatly simplifying our program and also separates our concerns. This way, we don't have 4 drones operating in an area in the Middle East and a few in the Arctic Seas or North China Sea for example.

- Add Kafka to decouple our data ingestion from our DB
